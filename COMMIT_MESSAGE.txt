v0.3.1: ESPN API Integration & Comprehensive Model Validation

## Summary
Completed comprehensive validation of moneyline model on 2025 Week 1-16 data (251 games),
integrated ESPN API for independent data sources, and identified path to improve accuracy
from 68.5% to 75%+ by reducing Vegas dependency.

## Model Performance (2025 Weeks 1-16)
- Moneyline: 68.5% accuracy (172/251), beats Vegas 67.3% by +1.2%
- High-confidence picks (80%+): 90% accuracy (34/38 games)
- Spread: 52.2% accuracy (minimal edge over 50% baseline)
- Totals: 50.6% accuracy (essentially random)

## Key Findings
1. XGBoost has proven edge on moneyline, especially high-confidence picks
2. Vegas correlation = 0.932 (too high - needs reduction to <0.85)
3. High-confidence picks = only 15% of games (need 25%+)
4. Week 16 validation: XGBoost 73.3% vs Vegas 60% (+13.3% edge)

## ESPN API Integration
- Researched and documented ESPN's hidden public API
- Built espn_independent_data.py wrapper (tested & working)
- Identified 323 independent stats per team (279 team stats + 44 record stats)
- Endpoints: team statistics, team records, roster/injuries, game summaries

## Feature Audit
- Identified 13 Vegas-dependent features (spread, total, moneyline odds)
- Identified 73 independent features (TIER S+A: CPOE, pressure, RYOE, separation, injuries)
- Missing: live 2025 injury data (currently imputed from 2024 medians)
- Missing: team offensive/defensive stats, QB/RB/WR performance, home/away splits

## Data Quality Issues
- 2025 injury data imputed from 2024 medians (not real-time)
- nfl-data-py has stale/incorrect odds for 2025 (SF @ IND had 8-point swing)
- Advanced metrics (CPOE, pressure, RYOE) imputed for 2025 games
- ESPN API only provides current week live data, not historical weeks

## Enhancement Roadmap (v0.4.0)
Phase 1 (Week 1): Data collection from ESPN API
Phase 2 (Week 2): Feature engineering with statistical validation
Phase 3 (Week 3): Model retraining with new features
Phase 4 (Week 4): Production deployment with monitoring dashboard

## Success Metrics
- Overall accuracy: 75%+ (vs current 68.5%)
- High-confidence accuracy: 90%+ on 80%+ picks (maintain)
- High-confidence volume: 25% of games (vs current 15%)
- Vegas correlation: <0.85 (vs current 0.932)

## Files Modified
- README.md - Updated with v0.3.1 status, performance metrics, roadmap
- espn_game_api.py - Enhanced with injury extraction

## Strategic Philosophy
The goal is NOT to ignore Vegas lines, but to:
1. Identify genuine independent edges that Vegas doesn't capture
2. Leverage Vegas information strategically (baseline, not feature)
3. Build feature-rich dataset with rigorous statistical validation
4. Scrutinize every feature addition with significance testing

## Next Steps
1. Create feature branch: feature/moneyline-enhancement-v2
2. Fetch ESPN data for all 32 teams (2024 & 2025)
3. Engineer new features with statistical validation
4. Retrain model and validate on 2025 data
5. Create Streamlit dashboard for feature tracking
