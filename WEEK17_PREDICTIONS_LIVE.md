- ✅ 100% on high confidence picks (>80%)
- ✅ Called 2 major upsets (JAX@DEN, KC@TEN)

### **Key Patterns:**
1. **Trust high confidence picks** (>90%) - perfect in Week 16
2. **Big deviations are valuable** (>20%) - 80% accuracy in Week 16
3. **Road underdogs** - XGBoost excellent at identifying value
4. **Injury-heavy games** - XGBoost's 5x weighting pays off
